# Framework-for-predicting-genetic-disorders
This is my solution for Hackerearth competition running until August 15 2021. I know it is public, you can copy my design if you want to. 0 fuqs given. Project consists of 2 main programs. First is a Framework designed to cope with the data given by the competition caller, while second program is an actual implementation based on the insights from the Framework. The whole software is console based and written in C.

Project details: You are given a dataset consisting of csv files containing training data, sample output and test data to check how good your prediction model is. The csv files were provided by task giver: "Hackerearth" and is provided in the "data" folder. The model is trained to predict Genetic disorder and Disorder subclass for every member in test data based upon the training data. Format of the output is given in the sample output.

The training data consists of multiple information harnessed from real patients. You can see details in the "train.csv" line 1, which describes every input of a standardized entry, which the Framework is designed to cope with.
